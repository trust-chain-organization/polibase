"""LangGraph tools for party member extraction.

This module provides LangGraph @tool wrappers around the PartyMemberExtractor.
The tools act as an adapter between the LangGraph framework and the extraction logic.

TODO(Clean Architecture): This tool currently depends on legacy
src/party_member_extractor/ module. Should be refactored to use:
- Domain: PartyMemberExtractionService
- Application: ExtractPartyMembersUseCase with proper DTOs
- Infrastructure: Updated implementation using Clean Architecture
Track migration in a separate issue.
